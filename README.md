# Stock Lookup App

This is a simple tool to lookup stocks and get data using the IEX API.

To run this app locally, go to the (iexCloud)[https://iexcloud.io] website and generate an API key.

Create a file called `.env` in the root directory of this project and add the API key like this:

```
REACT_APP_IEX_API_KEY= "YOUR_KEY_HERE"
```
